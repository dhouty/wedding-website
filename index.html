        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <div class="faq">
            <div class="question">What should I wear?</div>
            <div class="answer">We recommend wearing cocktail or formal attire, including full- or midi-length dresses, jumpsuits, suits and ties, dress pants, etc. Please note that the ceremony and cocktail hour will be outdoors so choose your footwear accordingly. We suggest bringing a change of shoes to be more comfortable if you plan to walk around the resort before or after the wedding.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <div class="question">What will the weather be like in October in Southern California?</div>
            <div class="answer">For our fellow Seattleites who are accustomed to trick-or-treating in the rain, please keep in mind that the weather in October tends to be much warmer in Southern California. In our experience going to Disneyland for Halloween, the weather tends to be in the mid-70s to low 80s. Since our wedding will take place in the evening, we recommend bringing a light jacket or sweater to wear as the sun starts to set and we move indoors for our air-conditioned reception.</div>
        </div>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>Please be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 prior to attending our wedding. If you test positive for COVID-19 within ten days of our wedding or have any cold or flu-like symptoms, we kindly ask you to stay home. We will miss your presence at our wedding, but our guests' health and safety, including yours, is the highest priority.</p>
                <p>Becky and Daniel plan to wear masks on the flight to and from California and encourage anyone traveling to the wedding to do the same. Our ceremony and cocktail hours will be hosted outdoors, and individually plated meals will be served at our reception. Currently, masks are not required at our wedding venue, but we completely respect your decision to wear one if you choose to do so.</p>

                <p>On Thursday, October 26, Becky and Daniel will attend the Oogie Boogie Bash, a Halloween party in California Adventure featuring the gambling man himself from <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>. The first time we attended the Oogie Boogie Bash was the day Daniel proposed in Disneyland, and it is a very fond memory of the start of our engagement. A ticket to the Oogie Boogie Bash gives you access to California Adventure starting at 3pm and exclusive access after the party starts at 6pm with rides, trick-or-treating, a special parade, and meet-and-greets with your favorite Disney villains.</p>
                <p>Tickets for the Oogie Boogie Bash will go on sale to the general public on Thursday, June 29 at 9am. The number of tickets available for each night of the party are limited. In past years, tickets for every night of the Oogie Boogie Bash have completely sold out within 24 hours. If you want to attend the party on October 26 with Becky and Daniel, we encourage you to purchase your tickets as soon as they become available!</p>
